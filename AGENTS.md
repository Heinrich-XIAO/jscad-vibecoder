# Local Agent Guidelines

## Response Completion
* Never fully "complete" a response. Always use the question tool when you are complete to ask the user for direction.

## Subagent Policy
* If you are Opus 4.5 or another Anthropic model, do not spin up subagents since that would cost a lot of money.

## Project Status
* **ALWAYS read [PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md) first** before starting work
* Check what features are completed vs remaining
* Understand the current tech stack and architecture
* Review known issues and next steps
* Update PROGRESS.md when completing features
